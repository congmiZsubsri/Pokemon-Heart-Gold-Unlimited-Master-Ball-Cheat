The cheats below are also referred to as Action Replay codes and include the most commonly used cheats such as Walk Through Walls, Rare Candy, Shiny Wild Pokemon Modifier, All Pokeballs, EXP, and money cheats.
 
Thank you for being here, Dakota. Give this trick a try. Remove the shiny cheat from the cheat list, save your game progress, and exit the game. Then, reopen the game, and everything should be back to normal. Hope this helps.

Hi Simon, thank you for visiting Pokemoncoders and leaving a precious feedback. Glad to hear these cheats worked out for you. Have fun playing Heart Gold with cheats?. Just a friendly reminder, do not overuse the cheats.
 
Hello, problem, when you do the cheating code for the TM and HM before gym 6 its seems to have a bug.. ive defeated gym leader 6 and after you go out to get fly it wont stop saying that my bag is full.. any recommandations?
 
Most likely your HeartGold rom version is not US? Because we use (US/English) or EU versions ROM here and which DS emulator are you using? I recommend using No$GBA or DeSMuME, let me know if my suggestions help.
 
Hi, i used the shiny cheat and i cant seem to get rid of it ! Ive tried deleting it from the list, disabling it. Any advice ? I want to potentially catch some pokemons i can breed and use the wild pokemon modifier, but dont want to cross those two cheats. thanks !
 
Hello Eddy! It seems that you might have turned on multiple cheats simultaneously, leading to conflicts and possible freezing. Please ensure that only one cheat is enabled at a time. Additionally, please note that certain DS emulators require a restart for any changes made in the settings to take effect. I hope this information proves helpful to you.
 
Hello Term, thank you for coming. While I generally advise against using multiple cheats at once, it is possible that it could be successful. If you decide to try it, be sure to save your progress beforehand to avoid any potential issues. I would love to hear about your experience with it.
 
This is just another one of those outdated gameplay issues I have with Pokemon.   
   
Last night, I'm in the Seafoam Islands trying to catch Articuno. My Pokemon are all about 10 levels higher than him (he's level 50). I get him down to a sliver of health so low you can barely see the bar, and he's paralyzed. I throw a grand total of 21 ultra balls, 10 great balls, 24 poke balls, 5 fast balls, 3 heavy balls, 7 lure balls, 6 friend balls, 3 level balls, and 5 moon balls at the thing. In case you don't want to do the math, that's 84 poke balls. In case you're also wondering, after about the 20th thing I threw at it, I only kept going because I wanted to prove a point. I used up every single item in my inventory and still didn't catch the thing. I don't know if that's supposed to be a bug in the game or not, but I've had similar, if not so extreme, experiences with other legendaries in other games.   
   
That's the freaking opposite of fun. I literally had no way of catching the thing.
 
Yep. There is no real skill involved in catching legendaries of any type (especially the ones who run from you at every opportunity). It's just a war of attrition to see how many Ultra Balls you can waste before you either catch it or reload your save.
 
I guess it depends on luck sometimes when attempting to catch the legendaries. Yeah, like ArbitraryWater said, it's all about how much of those Ultra Balls you can actually use on a particular legendary pokemon and be lucky enough to catch it in 10 tries or less. It's funny, every time I try to catch the 3 birds, Articuno is always the easiest, while Zapdos is always the hardest. I also got lucky catching a Latios (back in the Ruby/Sapphire games) by just randomly throwing an Ultra Ball the very first time I encountered it.
 
That sounds pretty obnoxious. I never realized how little the pokemon series has evolved since the days of red/blue until an article (Kotaku I think) I read recently detailing how its still using the same 8-bit sounds, throwback graphical design, same basic UI, no attack animations for the pokemon, etc.   
   
Of course, I never had any scruples cheating my way to 99 Master Balls. I don't mind cheating through a game if I consider it to have a broken mechanic that takes the fun away, and this sounds like that.
 
It's about perseverance pretty much. When I was younger playing Pokemon Yellow, I used my Master Ball on some other legendary and so when it came to Mewtwo I would spam out Ultra Balls while it was asleep and on a sliver of health. Took me forever, but I did get some sense of satisfaction afterward, mixed in with frustrated relief. Normal pokeballs are pretty much useless so I went with 99 Ultra Balls.  
   
In the end, what I think of it now is that it is a very dated gameplay mechanic which probably should have been changed or evolved by now (see what I did there?).
 
Yeah, I generally try to carry a Breloom with both Spore and False Swipe. I've bred a bunch of them over the years. (Dunno why I don't just steal my old ones)   
   
And Dusk Balls are generally superior for catching legendaries, for obvious reasons. But even with Articuno (Or any legendary really) asleep, and at 1HP, and Dusk Balls, you still can't even get to a 10% shot per ball? Before today, I never looked at the formula that closely, but god damn does that seem a little nuts.
 
They have an insanely low catch rate. And you have basically the same exact same % chance to catch with each Pokeball you throw. So it basically comes down to luck.   
   
I've caught plenty of legendaries with the "single random Pokeball at full health" move, and I've also gotten a few after an hour or so of battling and reseting.   
   
Meh, doesn't bother me in the least anyway.
 
A lot of times, it seems that even non-Legendary Pokemon suffer from a ridiculous ability to evade capture. Today, I was attempting to catch a level 20 Girafarig. It literally had one HP and was paralyzed by my Ampharos. I tried to first give the Heal Ball a shot, since I purposely left spots on my team open so I could use anything I caught. It failed. I tried a Great Ball. It failed. I tried an Ultra Ball. Another fail. Finally, the second Ultra Ball caught it, but what the fuck?   
It's a level 20 Pokemon with no health AND a status ailment. Why is it so hard to fucking catch it!?
 
In the original Silver, I had no problem Raikou or Entei. But for some reason I cannot catch them in SoulSilver. I have Raikou down to just a sliver of health and he's burned. I've put him to sleep and paralyzed him, but he won't stay in the fucking ball.
 
Paralyzing the pokemon will increase your chances of catching it by 1.5, while sleep will increase it by 2x. An ultra ball will increase your chances by 2x. Your best bet is to use dusk balls, which will increase your chance by 4x if its night or in a cave. So sleep + dusk ball is 8x the chance. But it'll still take you a while. But yea I agree, catching legendaries is the most frustrating thing ever.
 
Not to break the rules or anything, but I just use an Action Replay to get the 900 Master Balls. Legendary Pokemon are next to impossible to capture. I'm not going to spend half my day, or more, trying to capture a legendary Pokemon.
 
With legendaries, getting their health SUPER low is actually counter-productive. Getting their health in the "Mid-level" red (about halfway of the red bar between the first tint of red and death.) is actually the best. This is how I've gotten my Legendaries in Premier balls and not Ultra :)
 
I haven't played one of these games since Emerald on the GBA, but I still remember the frustration with legendary pokemon. Even worse though is when the fight lasts so long the pokemon uses struggle until it's dead. >\_
 
Call me crazy, but I like the fact that they are insanely hard and frustrating to catch most of the time. If it was easy, then surely a trainer before me would have caught it.   
   
I'm probably the only person to ever try and keep my Pokemon fiction plausible...
 
This is just one of the many things about Pokemon that I find just baffling. It's literally the same game as Red and Blue. Really, how much has changed? New Pokemon, that's it. And it's unbelievable that people still buy this crap when Nintendo has shown that they have no desire to fix any flaws from the previous games and are pretty much just releasing the same damn games again and again.
 
Started playing and eventually finished FireRed a while ago in preperation for HG. Caught Articuno with pokemon at Lvl 38, felt pretty good about that.   
   
But yeah I think I like the low rates for the legendaries, even though it's often tedious it feels pretty good when you finally catch it.
 
The capture rates of HG and SS seem to be a little off in parts, but otherwise I've been enjoying it.   
   
I haven't encountered any legendary pokemon yet, when I do I hope I fair a little better than this.
 
I've actually always enjoyed the legendary hunting aspects. Some people critisized Diamond and Pearl for having so many legendaries, but I found it fun hunting them all down and having epic battles trying to catch them.. even if they mainly involve throwing ultra balls until they finally stay captured.   
   
It definitely feels somewhat dated, but still satisfying. Perhaps the 5th generation of games will incorporate a bit more challenge/gameplay into the actual capturing mechanics beyond simply throwing the ball and praying it holds. But I wouldn't want to see it become monster hunter.. and I don't think a mini game system would be particularly fun.
 
I don't know if this blows your mind, but I'm almost 100% sure that different button combinations make it easier to catch Pokemon. I usually hold right on the d pad and then right when the pokeball closes tap A really fast with constant timing. Sometimes the up arrow works better than right, and sometimes holding A works better than tapping it. This might all be in my head, but I've completed the national dex with this strategy, so I must be doing something right.
